## 🧠 How Category Prediction Works

The app scans the expense description and matches keywords to predefined categories such as:

* Food & Drinks
* Shopping
* Transportation
* Utilities
* Entertainment
* Miscellaneous

Example:

```
"Starbucks coffee" → Food & Drinks
"Uber ride" → Transportation
```
